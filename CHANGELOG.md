# CHANGELOG


## v0.0.2 (2026-07-13)

### Bug Fixes

- **release**: Drop the duplicate build that broke publishing
  ([#3](https://github.com/fileworks/paperless-export/pull/3),
  [`a51f396`](https://github.com/fileworks/paperless-export/commit/a51f3963604e0777966a317f01d27cc9f1eec1bc))

The release job died at 'Build sdist + wheel' with

PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: dist/<pkg>-0.0.1.tar.gz

python-semantic-release already builds the sdist and wheel into dist/ via the build_command in
  pyproject.toml. It is a Docker action running as root, so those artefacts are root-owned. The
  workflow then ran a second, redundant 'uv build' as the unprivileged runner user, which cannot
  overwrite them.

Publish to PyPI and the Homebrew bump are both gated on that step, so a permission error on a build
  that never needed to happen silently took out the entire release.

Remove the duplicate build and the setup-uv step that only served it, and let the publish action
  consume the dist/ that semantic-release produced.


## v0.0.1 (2026-07-12)

### Bug Fixes

- **release**: Give checkout the release token so the version push is allowed
  ([#2](https://github.com/fileworks/paperless-export/pull/2),
  [`e201478`](https://github.com/fileworks/paperless-export/commit/e201478af0f822dbe19163edcfb1431f4427926d))

The release job fails with GH013 — the chore(release) version commit cannot be pushed to protected
  main.

Handing SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN to the python-semantic-release action is not enough: that input only
  authenticates GitHub API calls. The actual git push uses the credentials actions/checkout persists
  into the remote's extraheader, which were still the default GITHUB_TOKEN — an identity with no
  ruleset bypass.

Set the token on checkout as well, mirroring media-sorter's semantic-release workflow, so the push
  authenticates as an org owner and the always-bypass applies.

### Continuous Integration

- Allow CI to be triggered manually ([#1](https://github.com/fileworks/paperless-export/pull/1),
  [`ff5c192`](https://github.com/fileworks/paperless-export/commit/ff5c192cfcca77171f324f6f200c136a0a9f9879))

* ci: allow CI to be triggered manually

workflow_dispatch makes it possible to re-run checks without pushing a commit — needed while
  verifying the org's Actions allow-list, and useful any time a run fails for reasons outside the
  code.

* fix(release): push the version commit with a token that can bypass the ruleset

semantic-release commits the version bump to main. The branch ruleset requires a PR, and the default
  GITHUB_TOKEN has no bypass — GitHub rejects the Actions app as a bypass actor ("must be part of
  the ruleset source or owner organization"), so the release job could never land its commit.

SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN is a fine-grained PAT that acts as an org owner, who already holds an
  always-bypass on the ruleset. Falls back to GITHUB_TOKEN so nothing breaks where the secret is
  absent.
